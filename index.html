  <h2>For a select few UTA students, summer break is more than a chance to kick back and relax; it's an opportunity to immerse themselves in hands-on research in their chosen fields-and thanks to the UT System's Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Partnership Program, they can go all in.</h2>

  <h2>In summer 2023, when most college students are taking vacations and having fun in the sun, a group of UTA students were diving into the deep end of immersive research right here on campus and as far away as Singapore</h2>  
        <p>The students’ work was made possible through the
University of Texas System’s Louis Stokes Alliance for
Minority Participation (LSAMP) program, which is
geared toward students from historically underrepresented
populations. Named for American civil rights pioneer,
politician, and attorney Louis Stokes, the National
Science Foundation-funded LSAMP Summer Research
Academy provides selected students with a $4,000 stipend
to offset costs related to a 30-hour per week intensive
research experience. Students can study at one
of eight participating University of Texas campuses, or
          they can choose to study abroad.</p>
  
<p>During the program, students worked alongside
nationally and internationally recognized professors
performing supervised research and attending meetings
related to their fields of interest.
Bruce Vilaysane, who conducted research on tuberculosis
in the lab of Catherine Wein Min Ong at the
National University of Singapore (NUS), says the experience
brought benefits far beyond the research itself.
“Living in Singapore gave me such a unique and new
cultural perspective, especially given that Singapore is
a rich melting pot of different Asian cultures from the
surrounding countries,” he says. “As for the academic
side of my experience, it was probably a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity I will never forget. The NUS campus
was massive, and the facility that I worked at had cutting-
  edge research technology.”</p>
<p>Students in the program also received support to
attend the UT System LSAMP’s conference held at the
  University of Texas at El Paso.</p>
<p>For Christina Nguyen, a senior biology major who
          conducted her research locally, the El Paso conference was a highlight of her participation. At the conference,
she received a second-place award for her project on
antibiotic-resistant bacteria, an increasingly challenging
problem in health care, and something she will likely
learn more about if she achieves her dream of attending
  medical school after graduation.</p>
<p>“I gained valuable career insight from LSAMP directors
across Texas and friends from difference UT institutions
who are pursuing the same path as me,” Nguyen
  says.</p>
  
<p>Since its inception, more than 90% of UT LSAMP
scholars have gone on to graduate from UT System
schools, according to Excelencia in Education. Between
1993 and 2020, more than 2,100 students have participated
in the summer research academy, and more
than 350 have chosen to participate in the UT System
student research conference held in El Paso each year.
Additionally, more students statewide are pursuing
opportunities abroad. Between 2015 and 2020, 35 students
conducted research in Austria, England, France,
  Germany, Spain, Switzerland, and Taiwan.</p>
<p>“LSAMP has demonstrated how collaborative efforts
to encourage more students to pursue STEM research
can reap huge rewards,” says Kayunta Johnson-Winters,
interim director of the office of undergraduate research
at UTA and an associate professor of chemistry and
biochemistry. “This program serves as an impressive
example of Texas’ statewide commitment to improving
enrollment, retention, performance, and graduation
of underrepresented groups who have not always had
          access to higher education.”</p>
